export const aboutMeText = `With 2 years of professional engineering experience, I specialize in crafting intuitive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies like C/C++, React, Redux, Angular, TypeScript/JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. My passion lies in frontend development and problem-solving across diverse tech stacks.

Armed with a Computer Science degree, Iâ€™ve been actively sharpening my skills since college â€” participating in coding platforms, weekend hackathons, and occasionally bagging wins along the way. These experiences have helped me grow both technically and as a team player.

I thrive in dynamic environments and love exploring new technologies. Whether it's contributing to innovative projects or building something from scratch, I bring adaptability, creativity, and a hands-on approach to every challenge.
